  alternate paths, for learning Clojure, a modern Lisp implemented on
  top of the Java Virtual Machine.<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__18274"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__18274" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote"><em>Update</em>: Since this was written in 2012, a number of
  additional excellent books have come out. These include Carin
  Meier&rsquo;s <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034292.do"><em>Living Clojure</em></a>; Vandgrift and Miller, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vmclojeco/clojure-applied"><em>Clojure Applied</em></a>; and Daniel Higginbotham&rsquo;s, <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/"><em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em></a>. These are all great choices,
  and <em>Clojure for the Brave and True</em> is a strong competitor for the
  best introductory Clojure book.</span></span></span></p><p>In addition to a surprising number of very good resources out there
  for such a young language, there are resources specific to other
  Lisps which map reasonably well onto Clojure.</p><p>Clojure does have a learning curve, especially for one coming from
  imperative languages such as Java, Python, C++, or Ruby. These
  languages are, in some ways, more similar to each other than they
  are to functional languages such as Clojure (though they all have
  features which were pioneered originally in implementations of Lisp,
  one of the oldest computer languages).</p><p>Since the approach I took was somewhat haphazard and I have the
  benefit of some hindsight now, I present here a rough sequence which
  might make the road a little less bumpy for others. Though not an
  exhaustive list of resources by any means, the following diagram
  summarizes the discussion points that follows.</p><p><figure><a href="img/learnclojure2.png"><img src="img/learnclojure2.png" /></a></figure></p><p>The approach I recommend goes something like this:</p><p><span>If you are going to pick just one of these resources to get
  started, I recommend the O&rsquo;Reilly book <a href="http://www.clojurebook.com/">Clojure Programming</a> by C. Emerick et. al. I have both the PDF and print versions of
  this book, and it&rsquo;s not only an excellent book on Clojure, it&rsquo;s one
  of the best O&rsquo;Reilly books I&rsquo;ve seen in the dozen or so years I&rsquo;ve
  been reading them. The other two books are also good (I have not
  checked out the 2nd edition of Programming Clojure yet)&hellip; Clojure is
  particularly blessed in having not just one but at least three
  excellent &ldquo;starter books&rdquo; on the language.</span></p><p><span>If you&rsquo;re curious why one might want to learn a Lisp as your next
  (or last?) programming language, Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">evangelizes</a> very effectively about Lisp in some of his many <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a>. You might want to check those out before diving into
  Clojure per se.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, videos of Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talks, particularly <a href="videos">Simple Made Easy</a> , though not so much
  about Lisp or Clojure per se, explain the challenges and limitations
  involved with stateful Object-Oriented programming and motivate the
  ideas behind functional programming in general and Clojure in
  particular. I very much recommend these videos, though reaction to
  them among programmers I&rsquo;ve shown them to has varied wildly from
  enthusiasm to extreme irritation.</span></p><p><span>People with exposure to Common Lisp or Scheme may be familiar with
  Abelson and Sussman&rsquo;s <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> ; Friedman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a> and its sequels <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTSS/">The Seasoned Schemer</a> and
  <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BRS/">The Reasoned Schemer</a> ; and P. Seibel&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>, which I&rsquo;ve only peeked at but which has
  an excellent reputation. These books could provide a gateway into
  Clojure, or might merit a look at once you&rsquo;ve got some Clojure
  basics under your belt. I find them to be interesting supplemental
  reading.</span></p><p><span>Before getting to the more advanced books, the
  <a href="https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans">Clojure Koans</a> are a
  fun and pleasantly gradual way to start reinforcing your Clojure
  basics (I worked most of them on various airplane flights to the
  South Pole last year). Similar but somewhat more challenging are the
  <a href="http://4clojure.org/">4clojure problems</a> (I&rsquo;m about 3/4 of the way through these).</span></p><p>I find these kinds of problems alternately soothing (when I get
  them right away) and maddening (when I actually have to work at
  them). They are like crossword puzzles for programmers, and they do
  really help reinforce the material from the books. Due to the way
  the problems are implemented, they are unfortunately limited in
  terms of how they cover Java interoperability, macros, and
  concurrency.</p><p><span>After you&rsquo;ve read an introductory text, worked some problems and
  maybe started one or two personal projects with the language, you&rsquo;re
  ready for
  <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">The Joy of Clojure</a>. This book is somewhat hard to describe; I started it too early,
  then came back after six months and it make a whole lot more
  sense. The best way to explain The Joy of Clojure is that it helps
  you to understand both some of the quirks of the language and what
  makes it truly great, and will help you evolve from writing clumsy
  translations of what you&rsquo;ve learned in other languages, to truly
  compact, elegant, idiomatic Clojure code.</span></p><p><span>After, or perhaps during, Joy of Clojure, take a deep dive into
  macros, the secret sauce of Lisp. Macros allow one to implement new
  language features in order to make one&rsquo;s code elegant and
  expressive, and to optimize the fit to one&rsquo;s problem domain. Paul
  Graham&rsquo;s
  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> is mostly about macros; Hoyte&rsquo;s
  <a href="http://letoverlambda.com/">Let over Lambda</a>
  refers to On Lisp many times and builds on some of the foundations
  laid in that book.</span></p><p><span>To summarize (strongest suggestions in <strong>bold</strong>):</span></p><p><ol><li>Graham essays</li><li>Hickey videos</li><li>Introductory book (<strong>Clojure Programming</strong>,
   Programming Clojure, or Practical Clojure)</li><li>Possibly detour into SICP, Practical Common Lisp and/or The *
   Schemer books</li><li>Clojure Koans</li><li>4Clojure Problems</li><li><strong>Joy of Clojure</strong></li><li>On Lisp</li><li>Let Over Lambda</li></ol></p><p><span>There are many other Lisp books which I haven&rsquo;t read yet, as well
  as a Clojure book or two I&rsquo;ve left out. Also, lest I forget, the
  Clojure community has a reputation for being extremely welcoming and
  helpful. There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure">Google
  Group</a> / mailing list and an IRC chat as well.</span></p><p>The bottom line is that for such a young language (or young variant
  of an old language), we are fortunate to have such a rich selection
  of resources to pick and choose from. Enjoy!</p></div><div><p><a href="about-me.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about-me.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
