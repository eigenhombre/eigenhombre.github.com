_"This is my workflow.  There are many like it, but this one is mine."_ --Anon.

This is the first in a sequence of posts about my current workflow for developing in Clojure.  I call this workflow "advanced" because it takes time to learn the various tools involved, but also because it allows me to tackle harder problems than I otherwise could.

The basic ingredients of this workflow are:

* Lisp-related editor enhancements, including parenthesis magic, and, especially, in-editor REPL integration.
* Continuous testing with instant display of results
* Notebook-style semi-literate programming with continuous updating of documentation, display of math symbols, and in-page plots.

My setup has evolved over time and I expect it will be different by the time most people read this.  I have found, though, that the right combination of tools allows me not only to manipulate Clojure code and see results quickly, but also to [think more clearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) about the problem at hand.  In my experience, this leads to simpler, more elegant, more maintainable code.

These tools and techniques provide a sort of "sweet-spot" -- they help me be productive in the language, and I find them fun to use together.  Your mileage may vary -- I have seen people be productive with vastly different workflows and toolsets.

Without further ceremony, let's go straight to the first post, about [customizing Emacs for Clojure](/clojure/2014/07/05/emacs-customization-for-clojure/).
