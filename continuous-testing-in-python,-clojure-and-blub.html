  test-driven development, focusing mainly on Python and influenced by
  Clojure tools and philosophy. At the end, a simple script is
  introduced to help facilitate continuous TDD in (almost) any
  language.</strong></p><p><span>For the last four years I have increasingly followed a test-driven
  approach in my development. My approach continues to evolve and
  deepen even as some of the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/guard-rail-programming">limits of TDD</a> are becoming clearer to me.</span></p><p>Initially, I had a hard time getting my head around TDD. Writing
  tests AND production code seemed like twice as much work, and I
  typically ran the program under development, e.g. with print
  statements added, to test each change. But making changes to old
  code was always a fairly daunting proposition, since there was no
  way to validate all the assumptions I&rsquo;d checked &ldquo;by eye&rdquo; just after
  I&rsquo;d written the code.</p><p><span>TDD helps reduce risk by continuously verifying your assumptions
  about how the code should perform at any time. Using TDD for a
  <a href="http://npxdesigns.com/projects/icecube-live/">fairly
  large project</a> has saved my bacon any number of times.</span></p><p>The basic approach is that the test code and the production code
  evolve together more or less continuously, as one follows these
  rules:</p><p><ol><li>Don&rsquo;t write any production code without a failing unit test</li><li>Write only enough production code needed to make the tests pass</li></ol></p><p>Once I started writing tests for all new production code, I found I
  could change that code and make it better without fear. That led to
  much better (and usually simpler) code. I realized I was spending
  much less time debugging; and when there were bugs, the tests helped
  find them much faster. As I have gained experience with this
  approach I have found that the reliability of, and my trust in, my
  code written with TDD is vastly superior than otherwise. The
  two-rule cycle also tends to foster simplicity, as one tends to
  eschew any modifications that don&rsquo;t actually achieve the desired
  objectives (i.e. meet the goals of the software, as specified
  formally in the tests themselves). The process is also surprisingly
  agreeable!</p><p><span>It goes without saying that if you follow this approach you will be
  running your tests a lot. The natural next step is to automate this
  more. In the book Foundations of Agile Python Development, Jeff
  Younker explains how to make Eclipse run your unit tests <strong>every time you save a file</strong> in the project. The speed
  and convenience of this approach was enough to get me to switch from
  Emacs to Eclipse for awhile.</span></p><p><span>Most of my daily programming work is in Python, but I have been an
   avid <a href="http://johnj.com/navblog/in-defense-of-hobbies/">hobbyist</a> in Clojure for several months now. It wasn&rsquo;t until I
   saw Bill Caputo&rsquo;s preparatory talk for Clojure/West here in Chicago
   that I heard the term <strong>continuous testing</strong> and
   realized that this is what I was already doing; namely, the natural
   extension of TDD in which one runs tests continuously rather than
   &ldquo;by hand.&rdquo; Bill demoed the expectations module and the autoexpect
   plugin for Leiningen, which runs your tests after every save
   without incurring the overhead of starting a fresh JVM each time.</span></p><p>(One point Bill made in his talk was that if your tests are slow,
   i.e. if you introduce some new inefficiency, you really notice
   it. Ideally the tests should take a few seconds or less to
   complete.)</p><p><span>Back to Python-land. Not wanting to be always leashed to Eclipse,
   and inspired by the autoexpect plugin, I started looking for an
   alternative to using Eclipse&rsquo;s auto-builders &mdash; something I could
   use with Emacs or any other editor. There are a lot of continuous
   build systems out there, but I wanted something simple which would
   just run on the command line on my laptop screen while I edited
   code on my larger external monitor. I found <a href="https://github.com/brunobord/tdaemon/blob/master/tdaemon.py">tdaemon</a> on GitHub; this
   program walks a directory tree and runs tests whenever anything
   changes (as determined by keeping a dictionary/map of SHA values
   for all the files). This is most of what I want, but it restricts
   you to its own choices of test programs.</span></p><p><span>In a large project with many tests, some fast and some slow, I
   often need to specify a specific test program or arguments. For
   example, I have a wrapper for <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/">nosetests</a> which
   will alternately run all my &ldquo;fast&rdquo; unit tests, check for PEP-8
   compliance, run Django tests, etc. In some cases, such as debugging
   a system with multiple processes, I may need to do something
   complex at the shell prompt to set up and/or tear down enough
   infrastructure to perform an
   existing test in a new way.</span></p><p><span>One piece of Clojure philosophy (from Functional Programming,
   a.k.a. &ldquo;FP&rdquo;) that has been influencing my thinking of late is the
   notion of <strong>composability</strong>: the decoupling or
   disentanglement of the pieces of the systems one builds into small,
   general, composable pieces. This will make those pieces easier to
   reuse in new ways, and will also facilitate reasoning about their
   use and behaviors. (Unfortunately, the merits of the FP approach,
   which are many, have poisoned my enthusiasm for OO to the extent
   that I will typically use a function, or even a closure, before
   using an object, which would perhaps be more Pythonic in some
   cases).</span></p><p>So, in the current case under discussion (continuous testing),
  rather than making some kind of stateful object which knows about
  not only your current file system, but also what tests should be
  allowed, their underlying dependencies, etc., it would be better (or
  at least more &ldquo;functional&rdquo;) instead to simply provide a
  directory-watching function that checks a dictionary of file hashes,
  and compose that function with whatever test program suits your
  purposes at the moment.</p><p><span>The result of these thoughts is a small script called <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/continuous-testing-helper">conttest</a> which is a simplification of <code>tdaemon</code>
  that composes well with any test suite you can specify on the
  command line.</span></p><p>Some examples follow:</p><p><pre><code>$ conttest nosetests  # Runs nosetests whenever the files on disk change

$ conttest nosetests test.path:harness  # Runs only tests in 'harness'
                                        # object in path/to/test &mdash; handy
                                        # for developing a single feature
                                        # or fixing a single bug.
# Check both PEP-8 style and unit tests:
$ conttest 'pep8 -r . ; nosetests'
</code></pre></p><p><span>It would work equally well with a different language (&ldquo;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub</a> language&rdquo;) with a
  separate compilation step:</span></p><p><pre><code>$ conttest 'make && ./run-tests'</code></pre></p><p>Using this program, depending on my needs of the moment, I can
  continuously run a single unit test, all my &ldquo;fast&rdquo; unit tests, or,
  if I&rsquo;m willing to deal with slower turnaround times, all my unit and
  integration tests.</p><p><span>The script is on <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/continuous-testing-helper">GitHub</a> for your continuous enjoyment of continuous testing. May
  you find it helpful.</span></p><p><span>(Ironically, this script does NOT work that well for JVM languages
  like Clojure since the startup time is lengthy (a couple of seconds
  on my MacBook Pro). Most of the testing frameworks have autotest
  capabilities built in, which work great.)</span></p></div></body><div><p><a href="about.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
