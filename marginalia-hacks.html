     workflow.</strong></p><p>In my last post, I introduced Marginalia as a tool for
     (semi-)literate programming. Here are some tricks I&rsquo;ve used to
     make Marginalia work for me &mdash; in particular, to support a style
     of working with investigatory &ldquo;notebooks.&rdquo; As always, your
     mileage may vary.</p><p><span><strong>Problem: I want to reorder my code snippets</strong> to
     allow for more natural exposition.</span></p><p><span><strong>Solution</strong>: As discussed, Marginalia does not
     provide reordering or interpolation of source code in the same
     way that Knuth&rsquo;s WEB does. By default, <code>lein marg</code>
     processes all the Clojure source code in your project except in
     the <code>test</code> directory, presenting namespaces in alphabetical
     order. The problem is exacerbated by the one-pass Clojure
     compiler, which expects everything to be declared before it is
     used.I have been able to work around this to my satisfaction by
     specifying directories and/or files at the command line in the
     order I want them to appear. For example, if I wanted both <code>src</code> and <code>test</code> files in my output, and if
     I wanted <code>src/myproject/core.clj</code> to appear first, I
     would say<pre><code>lein marg src/myproject/core.clj src test</code></pre></span></p><p><span>If I wanted to reorder forms within <code>core.clj</code>, I could also just
     use Clojure&rsquo;s <code>declare</code> macro to forward-declare the
     vars at the top of the file. This is far from the power of
     Knuth&rsquo;s WEB, but it&rsquo;s been good enough for me.</span></p><p><span><strong>Problem: I want to see my Marginalia output as soon as
     I save my source code.</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Solution</strong>: It&rsquo;s nice to have quick feedback, so I
     use <code>conttest</code> to run <code>lein marg</code>, plus some Applescript (or equivalent) to reload the output in
     the browser.</span></p><p>Example:</p><p><pre><code>conttest 'lein marg && \
     osascript ~/bin/reload-browser.scpt \
     file:///path/to/project/docs/uberdoc.html'</code></pre></p><p><span>The Applescript <code>~/bin/reload-browser.scpt</code> is fairly simple,
     though you may have to adjust to suit your browser of choice:</span></p><p><pre><code>on run argv
    tell application &ldquo;Google Chrome&rdquo;
        set URL of active tab of first window to item 1 of argv
    end tell
end run</code></pre></p><p>Though it does take a few seconds, Marginalia not being a speed
     demon, one can get pretty quick visual feedback using this
     approach.</p><p><strong>Problem: I want to show expressions and the results of
     their evaluation together, a la iPython Notebook, Mathematica,
     Maple, Gorilla REPL, or Session.</strong></p><p><span><strong>Solution</strong>: For Clojure evaluation, I use the
     cider-eval-last-sexp-and-append trick I described in my previous
     post on customizing Emacs. This results in something like the
     following, in Emacs and in Marginalia:</span></p><p><span><figure><a href="img/emacs-eval.png"><img src="img/emacs-eval.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="img/marg-eval.png"><img src="img/marg-eval.png" /></a></figure></span></p><p><span>Here I added a single quote (<code>'</code>) to keep the
     resulting form from throwing an exception when the buffer is
     recompiled. This not quite iPython Notebook, but I find it gets
     me surprisingly far. And the source code remains completely
     usable as a whole, standalone program. This means I can combine
     notebook-style investigations directly in a working project
     without worrying how, eventually, to get the annotated code into
     production.</span></p><p><span><strong>Problem: I want nice looking math formulae</strong> in my &ldquo;notebook.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span><strong>Solution</strong>: Use the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> JavaScript library.</span></p><p>As shown in the images from the previous post, math can be
     typeset quite nicely with MathJax. This can either be imported
     directly from a CDN, as follows:</p><p><pre><code>;; &lt;script type="text/javascript&rdquo;
;;  src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"&gt;
;; &lt;/script&gt</code></pre></p><p><span>(this being done directly in the Clojure source file, comments
     being rendered as Markdown, and therefore HTML). Or, copy down
     the MathJax JavaScript source and use the <code>-j</code> argument to <code>lein marg</code>.</span></p><p><span>It took me a little time to figure out how to properly escape
     the TeX for inline math formulae. The usual pattern in HTML is to
     use <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code>, as follows:</span></p><p><pre><code>\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\)</code></pre></p><p><span>yielding \(r^2 = x^2+y^2 \) inline.</span></p><p><span>For this to work correctly, Marginalia makes you add another <code>\</code>:</span></p><p><pre><code>\\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\\)</code></pre></p><p><span>For inset math formulae, the required <code>$$</code> is unchanged:</span></p><p><pre><code>$$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$$</code></pre></p><p>Which gives:</p><p>$$r^2 = x^2 + y^2.$$</p><p><span><strong>Problem: I want to show graphs</strong> along with my text, code, and mathematics.</span></p><p><span><strong>Solution</strong>: Use a JavaScript plotting library, and a
     little Clojure to prepare the data.</span></p><p><span>This last hack is perhaps the most fun and the most &ldquo;hacky&rdquo; of
    the bunch. One of the best features of notebook solutions like
    iPython Notebook is the ability to show graphs inline with the
    code that generates them. This is not really in the wheelhouse of
    Marginalia, which was meant as a static documentation tool, but
    since we can incorporate JavaScript (as seen above, for
    mathematics), we can leverage existing plotting libraries. I use <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/i3d3">i3d3</a>, an open-source JavaScript plotting library built
     on top of <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.</span></p><p>The only obvious difficulty is how to get the data points into
     the browser for JavaScript to plot. For this, we need to do the
     following:</p><p><ol><li>Using the REPL, capture the Clojure data, format it as
     JavaScript, and write to a disk file in the project,
     <code>local.js</code>.</li><li>Load the resulting local.js, as well as any other needed
      libraries (in my case, d3, i3d3, and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore.js</a>) as part of
      the Marginalia command.</li></ol></p><p><span>The Clojure for Step 1 is shown in <a href="https://gist.github.com/eigenhombre/bed80ab20c2bab2ef9d7">this gist</a>. The i3d3 function, evaluated in the REPL, does the work of
      preparing the data on disk. The intermediate JavaScript file
      looks something like this:</span></p><p><pre><code>// BEGIN DIV plot2
i3d3.plot({"ylabel":"Entries",
           &ldquo;xlabel":"Priorities",
           &ldquo;size":[700,250],
           &ldquo;data":[{"type":"bars",
                      &ldquo;bins":[93991,103924,3396],
                      &ldquo;color":"grey",
                      &ldquo;range":[0,4]}],
           &ldquo;div":"plot2"});
// END DIV plot2</code></pre></p><p><span>(Multiple DIVs are supported in a single file by changing the
     DIV ID for each i3d3 function call in the REPL).</span></p><p>The command to continuously run Marginalia (Step 2) is:</p><p><pre><code>conttest &ldquo;lein marg src/liveana/core.clj \
         -c style.css \
         -j 'd3.v3.min.js;underscore-min.js;i3d3.js;local.js' \
         && osascript ~/bin/reload-browser.scpt \
                      file://path/to/docs/uberdoc.html&rdquo;</code></pre></p><p><span>Here I have put the JavaScript libraries in the <code>docs/</code> directory in advance; also, since i3d3 benefits from a style
     sheet, that is prepared and included in the Marginalia shell
     command as well.</span></p><p><span>Here&rsquo;s an example plot, from <a href="http://eigenhombre.com/example-notebook/">this notebook</a>:</span></p><p><figure><a href="img/plot-example.png"><img src="img/plot-example.png" /></a></figure></p><p><span>I told you it was hacky, but <a href="http://eigenhombre.com/example-notebook/">give the example a whirl</a> anyways. Since i3d3 supports panning and zooming, that comes for
     free!<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__18042"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__18042" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">Thanks to John Kelley / WIPAC for permission to show this work
     in this post.</span></span></span></p><p>As tools like Gorilla REPL and Session become more popular and
   powerful, I may discard this way of injecting graphs into
   &ldquo;literate&rdquo; programs. But I did want to see how far I could push
   Marginalia as a Clojure-based substitute for iPython Notebook,
   and found this approach surprisingly powerful. I might package it
   into something a bit more off-the-shelf if anyone else shows
   interest.</p><p>This concludes the series of posts on Clojure workflows&mdash;thanks
   to any of you who made it this far! The Clojure tooling landscape
   is constantly shifting, and I continue to learn new tricks, so
   things may look different a year from now. In the mean time,
   perhaps some people will find something helpful here.</p><p>Happy hacking!</p></div></body><div><p><a href="about.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
