  in July of 2010.</span></p><p><span>From <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/07/23/1142249/Managing-the-Most-Remote-Data-Center-In-the-World">Slashdot</a>:</span></p><p>&ldquo;Imagine that your data center was in the most geographically
  remote location in the world. Now imagine that you can only get to
  it 4 months of the year. Just for fun, add in some of the most
  extreme weather conditions in the world. That&rsquo;s the challenge that
  faces John Jacobsen, one of the people responsible for making sure
  that the data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory makes it all the
  way from the South Pole to researchers across the world. In an
  interview recorded at OSCON, Jacobsen talks about the problems that
  he has to face (video), which includes (surprisingly) keeping the
  data center cool. If you&rsquo;re ever griped because you had to haul
  yourself across town in the middle of the night to fix a server
  crash, this interview should put things in perspective.&rdquo;</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/v9VUk9xB6co" width="560"></iframe></p></div><div><p><a href="about-me.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about-me.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
