       together.<footer>Vincent Van Gogh</footer></blockquote></div></p><p><h1>Some things about me</h1><p>In no particular order: I tend to
    acquire a reputation as the &ldquo;clean code guy.&rdquo; I prefer to retire
    technical debt sooner rather than later. I like to strike the
    right balance between thinking things through in advance, and
    coding experimentally, discovering the truths of the problem at
    hand as I work. I enjoy tackling easy problems, because it&rsquo;s
    satisfying to get things done quickly, and I like hard problems
    that make me grow, think, and do things I never imagined
    possible. I like a mix of coding solo and working closely with
    others. I like working in beautiful environments that stoke
    creativity and passion. I am opinionated, especially with regards
    to the tools and approaches I&rsquo;ve arrived at through many years of
    growth, but I love learning new things from thoughtful people who
    are good at their craft.</p></p><p><h1>Practices I Like</h1><p><h2>&ldquo;Test First&rdquo;</h2><p><span>I am not a TDD zealot, but I&rsquo;ve had my tuchas saved many times
          by automated tests, and been burned more than a few by not
          having them. True TDD<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__22234"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__22234" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">Write the right minimum failing test first; write
          the minimum production code needed to make all tests pass;
          refactor to get to clean, DRY code; repeat.</span></span> is not
          without its costs, but it is one of my favorite strategies
          for ensuring good test coverage and, often, better design. I
          frequently combine REPL development and higher-level,
          end-to-end tests rather than testing slavishly at multiple
          levels of abstraction. I keep in mind the cost of tests in
          terms of code &ldquo;stiffness&rdquo; and try to write the <emO>right</emO> tests.</span></p></p><p><h2>Continuous Testing</h2><p>Most or all tests get run every time you save the file (at
         least), as often as once per minute or so. If your tests take
         too long for this to work, there&rsquo;s probably an architectural
         or performance problem that needs to be looked at.</p></p><p><h2>Promiscuous Pairing</h2><p><span>The team I currently work on has adopted &ldquo;promiscuous pairing&rdquo;<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__22235"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__22235" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">See A. Belshee, <em>Promiscuous
          Pairing and Beginner&rsquo;s Mind</em> (Google for PDF)</span></span> as a regular practice. We pair-program for 90 minute
          blocks, switching pairs twice a day (and solo programming or
          going to meetings the rest of the time).</span></p><p>This practice, while often tiring, is a great teaching
         technique.  At any given time, there is little tactical
         knowledge that I have that I don&rsquo;t trust my teammates to
         have, and vice-versa. People who practice promiscuous pairing
         (including us) relate the pleasures of teaching a technique
         to someone and then seeing another teammate using the same
         technique a short time later.</p></p><p><h2>Solo Programming</h2></p><p><h2>Retrospectives</h2></p><p><h2>Kanban over Scrum</h2></p><p><h2>Clean code</h2><p>Whenever I touch a piece of code, I try to leave it in better shape
         than I found it in.  I use style guides and build style checking
         tools into automated builds, because I&rsquo;ve found that better and more
         readable code results.</p></p><p><h2>Continuous Integration</h2></p></p><p><h1>Default Tools</h1><p>I use the following tools on a daily or near-daily basis.</p><p><h2>Clojure</h2></p><p><h2>Emacs</h2><p><span>Configuration <a href="http://github.com/eigenhombre/emacs-config">here</a>.</span></p></p><p><h2>Docker</h2></p></p><p><h1>Working with Teams</h1><p>...</p></p><p><h1>Technical Strengths</h1><p><h2>Troubleshooting and debugging</h2></p></p></div></body><div><p><a href="about-me.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
