  and show a trick which allows you to insert the result of any given
  Clojure expression directly underneath that expression.</em></span></p><p><span>As I said in the <a href="http://eigenhombre.com/clojure/2014/07/03/an-advanced-clojure-workflow/">first post</a>, a good set of tools can make a big difference in
  productivity and enjoyment while working in any language, and
  Clojure is certainly no exception. The most important tool in your
  toolbox, regardless of language, is your editor. Editing Lisp code
  in particular is much more natural with the right editor setup.</span></p><p><span>I have been using Emacs since the 1990s, though I still consider
  myself a novice (Emacs is that way). Though good alternatives
  exist, <a href="http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/">over half of the Clojure community has adopted Emacs</a> despite
  its lack of polish and its Himalayan learning curve. Emacs is
  massively customizable, with hundreds of plugins available, and can
  be extended to just about any degree using its own flavor of
  Lisp.</span></p><p><span>While I&rsquo;ll give a few Emacs configuration tips below, I don&rsquo;t give
  a complete recipe for customizing Emacs here. <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/emacs-config/">My Emacs
  configuration file</a> is on GitHub if you are interested.</span></p><p><h1>Paredit</h1><p><span>Though it takes a little getting used to, I started using <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e14.html">paredit mode</a> exclusively a year or so and it has made a huge difference, not
    only for my productivity with the language, but also in my
    enjoyment and appreciation of Lisp in general.</span></p><p><span>In paredit, the units of code are not lines of text or sequences
    of characters, but <em>s-expressions</em> (generally,
    lists). In other words, paredit gives you the ability to easily
    manipulate the data structures that your code is built out
    of. With various key combinations, you can kill expressions, split
    them, join them, expell (&ldquo;barf&rdquo;) or absorb (&ldquo;slurp&rdquo;) neighboring
    expressions, and so on. This <a href="https://github.com/joelittlejohn/paredit-cheatsheet">excellent
    cheat</a> sheet covers the whole range of commands and
    keybindings.</span></p><p>I think that it wasn&rsquo;t until I started using paredit that I
    really got used to all those parentheses. Now editing non-Lisp
    code feels unnatural to me, since I don&rsquo;t have the ability to
    sling blocks of code about with the same ease without those
    parentheses steering my editor. And, though it&rsquo;s hard to give a
    specific reason for this, working directly with trees of Lisp
    expressions gives me a feeling of somehow being closer to the
    essence of computation.</p></p><p><h1>CIDER</h1><p><span>An even more important tool is <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>, which integrates the Clojure REPL directly with Emacs. The
    upshot of this kind of integration is that one can <em>evaluate
    Clojure code directly from the editor</em> with a single key
    combination and see the results instantly.</span></p><p>I bind my own key combinations to the common CIDER commands to
    make them as quick to execute as possible:</p><p><pre><code>(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook
   '(lambda ()
      (paredit-mode 1)
      ;; Actual keyboard bindings follow:</code></pre></p><p><span>Start CIDER REPL with <code>control-o-j</code>:</span></p><p><pre><code>      (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd &ldquo;C-o j&rdquo;) 'cider-jack-in)
</code></pre></p><p><span><strong>Restart</strong> CIDER REPL
    with <code>control-o-J</code> (in case of dirty JVM, etc.):</span></p><p><pre><code>      (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd &ldquo;C-o J&rdquo;) 'cider-restart)</code></pre></p><p><span>Use <code>&#8984;-i</code> to evaluate previous expression and display
    result in minibuffer (I am on a Mac):</span></p><p><pre><code>      (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd &ldquo;s-i&rdquo;) 'cider-eval-last-sexp)</code></pre></p><p><span>Rather than showing in minibuffer, use <code>control-o y</code>
    to insert the result <em>directly in the code</em>.</span></p><p><pre><code>      (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd &ldquo;C-o y&rdquo;)
        (lambda ()
           (interactive)
           (insert &ldquo;\n;;=>\n&rdquo;)
           (cider-eval-last-sexp 't))) </code></pre></p><p>As an example of using this, suppose I have the following Clojure code:</p><p><pre><code>(range 100)
|</code></pre></p><p><span>With the position of my cursor denoted by <code>|</code>, and I type <code>control-o y</code>, I get:</span></p><p><pre><code>(range 100)
;;=>
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71
72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94
95 96 97 98 99)</code></pre></p><p><span>To see a video of this trick in action, check out this <a href="https://vimeo.com/99980843">demonstration
    video</a>. I find that using <code>cider-eval-last-sexp</code>
    feels a little like working with the InstaREPL in <a href="http://www.lighttable.com/">Light Table</a>, except that here you can actually preserve and edit the results
     of expressions rather than just viewing them inline. This is
     especially helpful for the style of semi-literate programming I
     will describe in a coming post.</span></p><p><span>Other Emacs plugins which I use and recommend are:<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode">clojure-mode</a>,
      which provides syntax coloring, indentation rules, and source
      code navigation;</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters">rainbow-delimiters</a>,
      which colorizes parentheses according to their nesting depth;
      and,</li><li><a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete">auto-complete</a>,
      which provides IDE-like auto-completion. </li></ol></span></p><p><span>To install Emacs packages, e.g. paredit, <code>M-x
    install-package [RET] paredit</code>. Or, steal the code from <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/emacs-config/blob/master/init.el">my init.el</a> file which installs and updates any missing
     packages from a list of packages you define.</span></p><p>Conference talks and online videos are a great way to find Emacs
    tricks to steal. For example, I&rsquo;ve seen people run unit tests from
    inside Emacs and display failures inline with the code, which is a
    very cool trick, though not exactly what I want. The best way to
    increase your Emacs-fu is to sit down with a grizzled Emacs guru
    and compare notes and techniques. I wish I had more opportunities
    to do this.</p><p><span>In <a href="testing,-continuously.html">the next post</a>, we&rsquo;ll talk about test-driven development and how
     &ldquo;RDD&rdquo; (REPL-driven development) and TDD enhance and complement
     each other.</span></p></p></div></body><div><p><a href="about.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
