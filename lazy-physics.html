     functional idioms in Clojure via the example of looking for
     (nearly-)coincident clusters of times in a series.</em></p><p>A fundamental technical problem in experimental particle physics
     is how to distinguish the signatures of particles from
     instrumental noise.</p><p><figure><a href="img/birds-on-wires.jpg"><img src="img/birds-on-wires.jpg" /></a></figure></p><p><span>Imagine a tree full of hundreds of sparrows, each nesting
     on a branch, each chirping away occasionally. Suddenly, for a
     brief moment, they all start chirping vigorously (maybe a hawk
     flew past). A clustering of chirps in time is the signal that <em>something has happened!</em> The analogous situation occurs
     in instruments consisting of many similar detector elements, each
     generating some amount of random noise that, on its own, is
     indistinguishable from any evidence left by particles, but which,
     taken together, signals that, again, <em>something has
     happened</em>&mdash;a muon, an electron, a neutrino has left a sudden
     spume of electronic evidence in your instrument, waiting to be
     read out and distinguished from the endless noise.</span></p><p><span>This process of separating the noise from the signal is
     known in physics as <em>triggering</em> and is typically done
     through some combination of spatial or time clustering; in many
     cases, time is the simplest to handle and the first &ldquo;line of
     defense&rdquo; against being overrun by too much data. (It is often
     impractical to consume all the data generated by all the elements
     &mdash;data reduction is the name of the game at most stages of these
     experiments.)</span></p><p><span>This data is typically generated
     continously <em>ad infinitum</em>, and must therefore be processed
     differently than, say, a single file on disk. Such infinite
     sequences of data are an excellent fit for the functional pattern
     known as <em>laziness</em>, in which, rather than chewing up all
     your RAM and/or hard disk space, data is consumed and transformed
     only as needed / as available. This kind of processing is baked
     into Clojure at many levels and throughout its library of core
     functions, dozens of which can be combined (&ldquo;composed&rdquo;) to
     serve an endless variety of data transformations. (This style of
     data wrangling is also available in Python via generators and
     functional libraries such as <a href="http://toolz.readthedocs.org/">Toolz</a>.)</span></p><p>Prompted by a recent question on the topic from a physicist and
     former colleague, I got to thinking about the classic problem of
     triggering, and realized that the time series trigger provides a
     nice showcase for Clojure&rsquo;s core library and for processing lazy
     sequences. The rest of this post will describe a simple trigger,
     essentially what particle astrophysicists I know call a &ldquo;simple
     majority trigger&rdquo;; or a &ldquo;simple multiplicity trigger&rdquo; (depending
     on whom you talk to).</p><p><span>Now for some Clojure code. (A small amount of familiarity with
     Clojure&rsquo;s simple syntax is recommended for maximum understanding
     of what follows.) We will build up our understanding through a
     series of successively more complex code snippets. The exposition
     follows closely what one might do in the Clojure REPL, building
     up successively more complete examples. In each case, we use <code>take</code> to limit what would otherwise be infinite
     sequences of data (so that our examples can terminate without
     keeping us waiting
     forever...).</span></p><p>First we create a sorted, infinite series of ever-increasing
     times (in, say, nsec):</p><p><pre><code>(def times (iterate #(+ % (rand-int 1000)) 0))
;; Caution: infinite sequence...

(take 30 times)

 15062 15171 15663 16355)
</code></pre></p><p><span><code>times</code> is an infinite (but &ldquo;unrealized&rdquo;) series, constructed by
     iterating the anonymous function <code>#(+ % (rand-int 1000))</code> which
     adds a random integer from 0 to 999 to its argument (starting
     with zero). The fact that it is infinite does not prevent us from
     defining it or (gingerly) interrogating it via <code>take</code>.<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__18100"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__18100" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">To model a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process">Poisson</a> process &mdash; one in which any given event time is independent of
      the future or past times &mdash; one would normally choose an
      exponential rather than a uniformly flat distribution of time
      differences, but this is not important for our discussion, so, in
      the interest of simplicity, we&rsquo;ll go with what we have
      here.</span></span></span></p><p><span>Now, the way we&rsquo;ll look for excesses is to look for
     groupings of hits (say, eight of them) whose first and last hit
     times are within 1 microsecond (1000 nsec) of each other. To start,
     there is a handy function called <code>partition</code> which
     groups a series in blocks of fixed length:</span></p><p><pre><code>(take 10 (partition 8 times))

in which some number of hits outside the trigger &ldquo;window&rdquo; are also
included in the output.  This is left as an exercise for the advanced
reader.</p><p><span>A &ldquo;real&rdquo; physics trigger would have to deal with many other
details: each hit, in addition to its time, would likely have an
amplitude, a sensor ID, and other data associated with it.  Also, the
data may not be perfectly sorted, some sensors may drop out of the
data stream, etc.  But in some sense this prototypical time clustering
algorithm is one of the fundamental building blocks of experimental
high energy physics and astrophysics and was used (in some variant) in
every experiment I worked on over a 25+ year period.  The
representation above is certainly one of the most succinct, and shows
off the power and elegance of the language, its core library, and lazy
sequences.  (It is also reasonably fast for such a simple algorithm; <code>smt-8</code> consumes input times at a rate of about 250 kHz.
This is not, however, fast enough for an instrument like IceCube,
whose 5160 sensors each count at a rate of roughly 300 Hz, for a total
rate of 1.5 MHz. A future post may look at ways to get better
performance.)</span></p></div><div><p><a href="about-me.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2015 <a href="about-me.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
