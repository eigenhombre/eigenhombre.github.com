I have been a software developer since the late 1980s, mostly working in the field of high energy physics and particle astrophysics.  My current specialty is developing distributed and/or Web-based applications for scientific computing, though I have done a fair amount of low level software engineering (Linux device drivers and embedded systems) as well.

I prefer iterative, test-driven development and fully-automated deployment workflows with frequent releases ("Agile").  I like Clojure, other Lisps, Python, Git, Eclipse, Emacs, and many, many more things.

The site for my "consulting business":http://npxdesigns.com has more details.  I'm also "on GitHub":http://github.com/eigenhombre and "StackOverflow":http://stackoverflow.com/users/611752/johnj

Occasionally I will post a review of a workshop, conference or other interesting tidbit on the following blog.  I also "tweet about various obsessions, software or otherwise":https://twitter.com/eigenhombre.
