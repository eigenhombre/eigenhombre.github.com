  macros, to DRY out repetitive code.</em></p><p><figure><a href="img/macro-sketch.jpg"><img src="img/macro-sketch.jpg" /></a></figure></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been writing Clojure full time for nearly two years now. I
  have a pretty good feel for the language, its virtues and its
  faults. Mostly, I appreciate its virtues (though I still wish the
  REPL started faster).</p><p>For me one of the language&rsquo;s attractions has always been that it&rsquo;s
  a Lisp &mdash; a &ldquo;homoiconic&rdquo; language, i.e., one defined in terms of
  its own data structures. Homoiconicity has one primary virtue, which
  is that it makes metaprogramming more powerful and straightforward
  than it is in non-homoiconic languages (arguably at some cost to
  readability).</p><p><span>In Lisp, this metaprogramming is accomplished with <em>macros</em>, which are functions that transform your code during a separate
  stage of compilation. In other words, you write little programs to
  change your programs before they execute. In effect, you extend the
  compiler itself.</span></p><p>I run a Clojure study group at work and find that it can be hard to
  explain the utility (or appeal) of this to newcomers to Lisp. This
  is partly because macros do things you can&rsquo;t easily do in other
  languages, and because the things you want to do tend to relate to
  abstractions latent in a particular codebase.</p><p><span>While <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/moarquil">playing around with 3d rendering</a> in <a href="http://quil.info/">Quil</a>, I recently came
   across a use case that reminded me of the following quote by Paul Graham:<blockquote><p>The shape of a program should reflect only the
   problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a
   sign, to me at least, that I&rsquo;m using abstractions that aren&rsquo;t
   powerful enough&mdash; often that I&rsquo;m generating by hand the expansions
   of some macro that I need to write<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__19150"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__19150" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">Paul Graham, <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html</a></span></span>.</p></blockquote></span></p><p>In Quil, there are multiple situations in which one needs to create
  a temporary context to carry out a series of operations, restoring
  the original state afterwards:</p><p><ol><li>Save current style with <code>push-style</code>; change
  style and draw stuff; restore previous style with <code>pop-style</code>.</li><li>Start shape with <code>begin-shape</code>; draw vertices; <code>end-shape</code> to end.</li><li>Save current position/rotation
   with <code>push-matrix</code>; translate / rotate and draw stuff;
   restore old position/rotation with <code>pop-matrix</code>.</li></ol></p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p><pre><code>(push-matrix)
(try
  (push-style)
  (try
    (fill 255)
    (no-stroke)
    (translate [10 10 10])
    (begin-shape)
    (try
      (vertex x1 y1 0)
      (vertex x2 y2 0)
      (vertex x2 y2 h)
      (vertex x1 y1 h)
      (vertex x1 y1 0)
      (finally
        (end-shape)))
    (finally
      (pop-style)))
  (finally
    (pop-matrix)))
</code></pre></p><p><span>The <code>(try ... (finally ...))</code> constructions may not be
  strictly needed for a Quil drawing, but it&rsquo;s a good habit to
  guarantee that stateful context changes are undone, even if problems
  occur.</span></p><p>In a complex Quil drawing the idioms for saving style, translation
  state, and denoting shapes appear often enough that one hungers for
  a more compact way of representing each.  Here&rsquo;s one way to do it:</p><p><pre><code>(defmacro with-style [& body]
  (push-style)
  (try
    ~@body
    (finally
      (pop-style))))


(defmacro with-matrix [& body]
  (push-matrix)
  (try
    ~@body
    (finally
      (pop-matrix))))


(defmacro with-shape [& body]
  (begin-shape)
  (try
    ~@body
    (finally
      (end-shape))))

</code></pre></p><p>The original code then becomes more compact and easier to read:</p><p><pre><code>
(with-matrix
  (with-style
    (fill 255)
    (no-stroke)
    (translate [10 10 10])
    (with-shape
      (vertex x1 y1 0)
      (vertex x2 y2 0)
      (vertex x2 y2 h)
      (vertex x1 y1 h)
      (vertex x1 y1 0))))</code></pre></p><p><span>In <a href="https://github.com/eigenhombre/moarquil/blob/master/src/moarquil/render.clj">this example code</a>, the contexts <code>with-matrix</code>, etc. appear so often that the resulting savings in lines of
  code and mental overhead for the reader is substantial.</span></p><p><span>However, the astute reader will realize that the macro definitions
  themselves are pretty repetitive&mdash;in fact, they look almost
  identical except for the setup and teardown details (this kind of
  &ldquo;context manager&rdquo; pattern is common enough that Python has <a href="http://eigenhombre.com/2013/04/20/introduction-to-context-managers/">its own language construct</a> for it).</span></p><p>I generally reach for macros when I have a pattern that occurs with
  obvious repetition that&rsquo;s not easy to abstract out using just pure
  functions.  Control abstractions such as loops or exception handling
  are common examples. (I find this situation occurs especially
  frequently when writing test code).</p><p>In any case, the solution for our repetitive macros could be
  something like:</p><p><pre><code>(defmacro defcontext
  [nom setup teardown]
  `(defmacro ~(symbol (str &ldquo;with-&rdquo; nom))
     [~'& body#]
     `(do
        ~'~setup
        (try
          ~@body#
          (finally
            ~'~teardown)))))</code></pre></p><p><span>Yikes! I have to admit I had to write a lot of macros, and also refer to <a href="http://hubpages.com/technology/Clojure-macro-writing-macros">this
  helpful page</a> for reference, before I could write (and grok) this macro.</span></p><p><span>With <code>defcontext</code> in hand, our repetitive macro code
  just becomes:</span></p><p><pre><code>(defcontext style (push-style) (pop-style))
(defcontext shape (begin-shape) (end-shape))
(defcontext matrix (push-matrix) (pop-matrix))</code></pre></p><p><span>These are exactly equivalent to the three context macros (<code>with-*</code>) defined above.</span></p><p><span>With a little effort, it&rsquo;s actually not too hard to construct such
  a nested macro. It&rsquo;s largely a matter of writing out the code you
  want to generate, and then writing the code that generates it,
  testing with <code>macroexpand-1</code> at the REPL as you go. <a href="http://hubpages.com/technology/Clojure-macro-writing-macros">This page by A. Malloy</a> has a lot of helpful remarks,
  including this cautionary note: &ldquo;Think twice before trying to nest
  macros: it&rsquo;s usually the wrong answer.&rdquo; In this case, I actually
  think it&rsquo;s the right answer, because the pattern of a context with
  setup and teardown is so common that I know I&rsquo;ll reuse this macro
  for many other things&mdash;we have effectively added one of
  my favorite Python features to Clojure in just a few lines of
  code<span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="G__19151"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="G__19151" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote">To be even more like Python&rsquo;s context managers, <code>defcontext</code> would want to enable the user to
              bind some local state resulting from the setup phase of
              execution (&ldquo;<code>with x() as y:</code>&rdquo; idiom);
              examples include file descriptors or database
              connections.  This is left as an exercise for the
              reader.</span></span>.</span></p><p><span>There&rsquo;s a saying in the Clojure community: <code>data >
  functions > macros</code>. I&rsquo;m a big believer in this. Clojure&rsquo;s
  powerful built-in abstractions for wrangling data in all its forms
  make it the language I prefer above all others these days. But
  occasionally that means wrangling the data that is the code itself,
  thereby reaping the benefits in power, brevity and expressiveness.</span></p><p><figure><a href="img/moarquil.png"><img src="img/moarquil.png" /></a><figcaption><span>Image generated by the Quil code used for this example; original
