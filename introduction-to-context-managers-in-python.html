  integration testing, mostly focused on Python.</em></p><p>Context managers are a way of allocating and releasing some sort of
  resource exactly where you need it. The simplest example is file
  access:</p><p><pre><code>with file(&ldquo;/tmp/foo", &ldquo;w&rdquo;) as foo:
    print >> foo, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</code></pre></p><p>This is essentially equivalent to:</p><p><pre><code>foo = file(&ldquo;/tmp/foo", &ldquo;w&rdquo;)
try:
    print >> foo, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
finally:
    foo.close()</code></pre></p><p>Locks are another example. Given:</p><p><pre><code>import threading
lock = threading.Lock()</code></pre></p><p>then</p><p><pre><code>with lock:
    my_list.append(item)</code></pre></p><p>replaces the more verbose:</p><p><pre><code>lock.acquire()
try:
    my_list.append(item)
finally:
    lock.release()
</code></pre></p><p><span>In each case a bit of boilerplate is eliminated, and the &ldquo;context&rdquo;
  of the file or the lock is acquired, used, and released cleanly.Context managers are a common idiom in Lisp, where they are usually
  defined using macros (examples are <code>with-open</code> and <code>with-out-str</code> in
  Clojure and <code>with-open-file</code> and <code>with-output-to-string</code> in Common
  Lisp).</span></p><p><span>Python, not having macros, must include context managers as part of
  the language. Since 2.5, it does so, providing an easy mechanism for
  rolling your own. Though the default, &ldquo;low level&rdquo; way to make a
  context manager is to make a class which follows the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager">context management protocol</a>, by
    implementing <code>__enter__</code> and
  <code>__exit__</code> methods,
  the simplest way is using the <code>contextmanager</code> decorator from the
  contextlib library, and invoking <code>yield</code> in your context manager
  function in between the setup and teardown steps.</span></p><p><span>Here is a context manager which you could use to time <a href="http://eigenhombre.com/2013/04/19/processes-vs-threads-for-testing/">our threads-vs-processes testing</a>, discussed previously:</span></p><p><pre><code>import contextlib
import time

@contextlib.contextmanager
def time_print(task_name):
    t = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print task_name, &ldquo;took", time.time() - t, &ldquo;seconds.&rdquo;

with time_print(&ldquo;processes&rdquo;):
    [doproc() for _ in range(500)]

# processes took 15.236166954 seconds.

with time_print(&ldquo;threads&rdquo;):
    [dothread() for _ in range(500)]

# threads took 0.11357998848 seconds.</code></pre></p><p><h2>Composition</h2><p>Context managers can be composed very nicely. While you can
  certainly do the following,</p><p><pre><code>with a(x, y) as A:
    with b(z) as B:
        # Do stuff</code></pre></p><p>in Python 2.7 or above, the following also works:</p><p><pre><code>
with a(x, y) as A, b(z) as B:
    # Do stuff</code></pre></p><p><span>with Python 2.6, using <code>contextlib.nested</code> does almost
  the same thing:</span></p><p><pre><code>with contextlib.nested(a(x, y), b(z)) as (A, B):
    # Do the same stuff</code></pre></p><p><span>the difference being that with the 2.7+ syntax, you can use the
  value yielded from the first context manager as the argument to the
  second (e.g., <code>with a(x, y) as A, b(A) as C:...</code>).</span></p><p>If multiple contexts occur together repeatedly, you can also roll
  them together into a new context manager:</p><p><pre><code>import contextlib

@contextlib.contextmanager
def c(x, y, z):
    with a(x, y) as A, b(z) as B:
        yield (A, B)

with c(x, y, z) as C:  # C == (A, B)
    # Do that same old stuff</code></pre></p><p>What does all this have to do with testing? I have found that for
complex integration tests where there is a lot of setup and teardown,
context managers provide a helpful pattern for making compact, simple
code, by putting the &ldquo;context&rdquo; (state) needed for any given test close
to where it is actually needed (and not everywhere else). Careful
isolation of state is an important aspect of functional programming.</p><p>More on the use of context managers in actual integration tests in
the next post.</p></p></div><div><p><a href="about-me.html">about</a>|<a href="content.html">all posts</a></p><p>&copy; 2016 <a href="about-me.html">John Jacobsen</a>.
